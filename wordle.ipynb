We could select the [words_aplpha.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt) file and place all words that aren't of length 5 into a list. Printing the length of this list tells us we have the 15,918 most common 5-letter English words. So, unless the people at Wordle are feeling particulary cruel, we probably have the answer here somewhere. \n",
